# Learning Rust

These are my notes as I read/work through [The Rust Programming Language][def1].

This is Rust's approach to handling memory management and differs from many programming languages.

Because Rust is a systems programming language, you need to be aware of whether your values are stored on the stack or the heap in your program.
